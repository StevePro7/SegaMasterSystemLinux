WEAPON
sword		1
axe		2

ARMOR
kolch		1
teligay		2


Tips
buy sword OR buy kolchuga first with 10x gold
and fight to gain XP and more gold

if you are losing the fight then run away i.e. not to die / game over

after every fight you have with enemy in forest 
next action to do : REST
this will reset your HP to current max HP

once you battle the boss KOLY
make sure you think you can beat
because once you start battle you can beg or fight
but you cannot run away or quit out


Shop
if you have an item e.g. sword or +1 life and you buy the item again
then you do not get 2x sword or +2 life but you will spend the gold
ie. there is no validation to check first before the gold is deducted


Battle
When you fight enemy in forest or Kol boss and you have armor
game will calc'd player damage from HP then will add 1 or 2 HP back
to compensate your protection
e.g. kolcy
start HP = 10
damage   = 2
so don't freak out  when you see after HP= 9
as 10 - 2 + 1 = 9


CHEAT
during battle you can "run away" 
unconditionally using fire2
otherwise fire1 has 50/50 chance you may lose 1x HP "could not run away"


The SEGA SC-3000 port has white on full blue background
but default for Sega Master System is white on black

however, during Splash screen hold joystick down and press fire2
to switch black background to blue for full game session
