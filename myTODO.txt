BUG
#1.

press fire1 to buy something then press fire1 to buy again "Not enough!" and stall SFX

#2.
victory

#3. cosmetic
forest screen
enemy dead but still modifies your HP score

#4.
//boss music messed up!!
//forest then boss
//boss easy now??
    


player + enemy
calc enemy damage 	0,1,2,3,4
add enemy AX		1,2,3,4,5

N = player HP
S = player damage
subtract S	enemy damage
add      ARM	player armor

N = N - S + ARM


enemy + player
calc player damage 	0,1,2,3,4
add player weapon 0,1,2
if pd =4 then re-add weapon	0,1,2

HPLO = enemy HP
HPLO = HPLO - D


player + boss
calc enemy damage 	0,1,2,3,4
add enemy AX		4


In the readme ensure that the armor is mentioned in forest screen so as to not cause confusion
i.e.
HP = 8 but player damage = 2 so balance should be 6 but would be 7 if armor = 1

IMPORTANT
I seemed to have some issue when I used rand()
I got zero when multiplying value by 3
e.g.
talk_screen
so in the end get rand() value and call function
with value injected and do the multiply in func
