accepts inputs [commands [actions]] but works out whether they should be actioned and
if the input should be actioned then CK records an event

CK during demo mode plays back all the events


Replay system: record inputs or events?

If you save the actions then you can use them [commands] as test data later

This can help with diagnosing crash bugs, finding behavioural regressions btwn builds etc.
