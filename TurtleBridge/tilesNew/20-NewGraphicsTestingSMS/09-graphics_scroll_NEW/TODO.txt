collision detection
//TODO check to see if only this code is necessary as the player_state will be isOnGround and all other player properties set from the bounds check earlier in the frame...

01.
//test all new changes to 
//po->player_frame = 4;
//po->player_frame = updatePlayerFrameGroundToFlying( po->player_frame );

02.
//player_animate();
//only check if player isonground && player_frame < 4
//[player_frame_theair_rght_01]

//player_frame = 1-player_frame 
//does this work for left??

03.
//collision detection update
//po->player_frame = 0;
//in the air && frame not 4 or 8 then ignore platform check
//i.e. deltaY > 0

04.
animation manager
delegate all frame calculation here as ugly code for
animate, swap, flip etc.

04.
jump logic to calculate jump array 1-4 otherwise gravity jump array 0

Locale Mgr stored in the Fixed Bank

#define	will store hard coded text in main ROM
but the array of char* in fixed bank will not render due to ROM bank to fixed bank for text
then ROM bank to bank2 for graphics

unless I put all the text in bank2 which is the same bank as the font graphics

// TODO set this correctly for checkpoint and test
void engine_scroll_manager_screen( unsigned char screen );
so->offset_right += screen * SCREEN_WIDE


Get the parallax scroll working with array
scroll_xy[]

as I believe the memory is still potentially corrupt..!!
I think all I need to do is this

extern unsigned int scroll_xy[];
unsigned int scroll_xy[] = { 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, };

I need to be able to load any screen [checkpoint] at any time
and update the offset for the load collision

Iterate delta in value loop but add that delta to player move right
and check the collision routine still works OK


Automate the level manager to include
fixedbank


Game controller
e.g.
start to find starting height using
level_mgr
player_mgr

Tidy up 
draw waves / sea gfx mgr => tile mgr
add white block to title and do HW build w/ and wo/ to compare
stevepro() generic function to draw stuff - break out	e.g. clouds + title etc

tile mgr replace tile_object with fixed bank values

bank the level data!
