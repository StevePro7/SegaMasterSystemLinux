I need to be able to load any screen [checkpoint] at any time
and update the offset for the load collision

Iterate delta in value loop but add that delta to player move right
and check the collision routine still works OK


Automate the level manager to include
fixedbank


Game controller
e.g.
start to find starting height using
level_mgr
player_mgr

Tidy up 
draw waves / sea gfx mgr => tile mgr
add white block to title and do HW build w/ and wo/ to compare
stevepro() generic function to draw stuff - break out	e.g. clouds + title etc

tile mgr replace tile_object with fixed bank values

bank the level data!
